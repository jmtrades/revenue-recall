# In-house call gateway

The self-hosted telephony brain for Revenue Recall. It lets the product place
and hold **real phone calls** where the AI listens and speaks — with **your**
speech-to-text, **your** Opus brain, and **your** neural voice — running on
**your** hardware. No voice vendor, no per-minute platform markup. The honest
meaning of "in-house": every layer is yours except the wholesale dial-tone.

## What's yours vs the one unavoidable outside line
| Layer | In-house? |
|---|---|
| Speech-to-text (listening) | ✅ `faster-whisper`, your hardware, open model |
| Brain (what to say) | ✅ Opus via your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (you chose Opus) |
| Voice (speaking) | ✅ your `neural-voice` service (your weights, your cloning) |
| Call control + media | ✅ self-hosted **FreeSWITCH** (open-source, MPL) |
| **Reaching a real phone number** | ⚠️ a **SIP trunk** — wholesale dial-tone. *Physics + telecom law: no one can originate a PSTN call without carrier interconnect.* Commodity (≈¢/min), not a software/voice vendor. |

So: you own the AI, the voice, the logic, the media server. The only thing you
"pay outside" for is the phone line itself — and that's true for everyone,
including the big platforms (they resell the same trunks with a markup you skip).

## Honest status (read this)
- **AI voice-agent core — real and built here:** the STT → Opus → neural-voice
  turn-taking loop (`agent.py`, `stt.py`, `brain.py`, `tts.py`) and the app
  webhook contract (`server.py`) are real, importable Python.
- **Live PSTN media — your stand-up:** the SIP/RTP bridge (`sip.py`) drives
  **FreeSWITCH** (originate + `audio_fork` media over WebSocket). FreeSWITCH and
  a SIP trunk run on *your* box; that part can't be exercised from CI without a
  trunk + a phone. It's wired and documented, not magic.
- **Reaching true "better than everyone" on live calls is earned in production**
  — latency tuning, barge-in feel, voice quality — on your hardware. This gives
  you the best possible foundation to get there; it does not pretend a phone
  agent is flawless on day one.

## How the app talks to it
The app's comms layer (`src/lib/comms.ts`) already routes voice/SMS to a generic
webhook with **zero app code** — point it here:
```
VOICE_WEBHOOK_URL = https://your-gateway/voice
SMS_WEBHOOK_URL   = https://your-gateway/sms        # optional, same trunk
COMMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN = <shared secret>               # sent as Bearer; we verify it
```
The app POSTs `{ channel, to, from }` plus optional briefing fields the agent
uses: `context` (who/why), `opener` (personalized first line), `voiceId`,
`voicemail` (a ready, personalized message to leave if the line goes to a
machine — speak it from your answering-machine-detection hook, see
`CallAgent.leave_voicemail`), and `meta` (echoed back to `/api/calls/log`). The
gateway originates the call and runs the agent. Nothing in the app changes —
flip the env var and calls go in-house.

## Run it
```bash
cd services/call-gateway
pip install -r requirements.txt

# point at your own services + trunk (see config.py for all vars):
export NEURAL_VOICE_URL=ws://localhost:8765          # your neural-voice service
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your Opus key>"           # your Opus brain
export FREESWITCH_ESL_HOST=127.0.0.1                 # your FreeSWITCH
export SIP_TRUNK_GATEWAY=my_trunk                    # your SIP trunk (in FreeSWITCH)
export COMMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=<shared secret>

uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```
`docker build -t rr-call-gateway . && docker run -p 8080:8080 rr-call-gateway`

## Why this beats a managed platform for you
- **Your voice, unlimited** — clone each rep, no per-character bill.
- **Your data** — call audio never leaves your infra (STT + TTS are local).
- **Your economics** — wholesale trunk minutes, no platform markup on voice/AI.
- **Your control** — swap the STT/voice/brain models freely; the seams are stable.
